This script will setup public key authentication for a remote SSH host that
you currently have password access to.  The advantage to this somewhat complex
method is that it only requires entering the password once to perform all the
necessary operations.  When complete, it will then log you in so you can poke
around.

It support two modes, for example:

  sshify root@192.168.217.132

If I also want to automagically add an alias to ~/.ssh/config for this host:

  sshify root@192.168.217.132 centos

Later I can just 'ssh centos', and no passwords will be needed!
